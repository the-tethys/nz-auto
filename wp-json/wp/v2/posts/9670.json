They handle well, have plenty of power and are efficient too, meaning you can get from A to B quickly and without spending a lot of money on petrol. Audi drivers always enjoy a good driving experience especially when mainatiend with a regular Audi car service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Style And Fashion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail are what make Audi vehicles so special. They&#8217;re designed with the driver&#8217;s comfort in mind, from their luxurious leather seats to their spacious interiors that provide plenty of room for passengers too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Safety<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety performance of Audi cars is excellent, with many of the brand&#8217;s models being five-star rated for their safety features and include a number of the more modern safety features including lane departure warnings and electronic driver assist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fuel Economy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fuel economy on Audi cars is great, saving the owner a good bit of money in the long run. With an average fuel economy of 9.8 litres per 100 kilometres for an Audi Q7 SUV, this delivers both high performance and high efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Expense<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi cars generally aren&#8217;t particularly expensive to maintain when compared with other luxury car brands. However, it&#8217;s still important to stick to the manufacturer&#8217;s servicing recommendations and Audi car service in order to ensure your car remains in top condition with components replaced as per the manufacturer logbook recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Audi Problems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Audi\u2019s are built with reliability and durability in mind, as with any other make of vehicle they are prone to a number of the more common mechanical issues that occur over time and will require Audi mechanics in Sydney, these include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Transmission<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi cars have been known to suffer from faulty transmissions from time to time, which can result in them not going into gear properly or even stalling at low speeds. This problem is more prevalent in older makes and models, however it&#8217;s still important that you get your newer model Audi checked out if there are any signs of trouble with shifting between gears (such as hesitation). If left unchecked this kind of fault could lead to major damage and need Audi mechanics in Sydney, over time so make sure you keep an eye out for signs of early transmission problems such as jerking motions while driving or grinding noises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Electrical<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrical faults are also quite common with Audi cars, and they can range from minor issues like dashboard warning lights coming on to more significant problems such as the engine cutting out completely while driving. If you experience any kind of electrical problem with your Audi and if you are in need of Audi repairs in Sydney or if any warning lights come on that indicate an electrical problem, it is best to contact us at VAR Automotive for diagnosis and repair as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Airbags<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common issue with Audi cars is faulty airbags, which can cause them to not deploy correctly in the event of an accident. If your Audi has been recalled for this reason, it&#8217;s important to get it fixed as soon as possible as an undeployed airbag could lead to serious injury in the event of a crash. At VAR Automotive we can inspect your airbags for any signs of damage and proper function and replace them as needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Timing Belt<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, wear and tear will deteriorate the timing belt leading to it working less efficiently than it should, with this potentially putting excess stress on other parts and leading to their deterioration. If you notice that there is a ticking noise coming from the engine area, or your car is revving differently to normal, you may be in need of Audi mechanics in Sydney &#8211; time to bring your Audi into us for an inspection!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Oil Leaks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any other type of vehicle, Audi engines can sometimes leak oil and the sooner this issue is diagnosed and fixed the less potential damage will occur to other parts of the vehicle. If you notice that there are spots of oil on your driver or where you normally park your Audi, or if the oil warning light comes on, it is time to book in your Audi car service with us to prevent further possible damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Regular Audi Service<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any vehicle brand, make, or model, it&#8217;s important to maintain your Audi by having regular logbook servicing and preventative maintenance undertaken in accordance with the Audi manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations. This ensures that everything is working as it should be and helps avoid problems later down the track which could&nbsp; prove to be costly. Maintaining the Audi logbook service schedule is a good way of keeping track of when your car needs servicing and what other Audi repairs might need doing in the future such as brake pad replacement or transmission repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Often Should You Have Your Audi Serviced?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on the make and model of your Audi, as well as how often you drive it. Generally speaking, Audi\u2019s fixed service intervals are based on an average driving period of approximately 15,000km per year. Therefore a scheduled Audi car service is due every 12 months or 15,000km\u2019s (whichever occurs first). However, if there are any signs of problems between recommended service intervals, or you are constantly driving under exhaustive conditions such as heavy city driving, it would be advisable to have your Audi serviced on a more regular basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Benefits of a Regular Audi Service<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of benefits of regularly servicing your Audi vehicle, these include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; A smoother and more enjoyable driving experience for you<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; An improved fuel economy, meaning less money spent at the petrol station<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Increased safety on the road as well as peace of mind knowing that your vehicle is in good condition<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#8211; An extended lifespan with your Audi vehicle running smoother and for longer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#8211; Piece of mind knowing that your Audi is in good working mechanical condition<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#8211; Your are less likely to suffer a frustrating breakdown if your Audi is regularly maintained and in good condition<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#8211; Maintained value and a higher resale value when it comes time to upgrade to the newest Audi model<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audi Servicing at VAR Automotive<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at our VAR workshop, we have a team of qualified mechanics in Sydney who are experts in all things Audi with over 20 years experience servicing Audi\u2019s so whether you need a logbook service, some basic preventative maintenance or some extensive repairs done, contact us today to book in your next Audi car service and rest assured your car is in good hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-4755501 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default qodef-elementor-content-no qodef-elementor-stretch-row-no qodef-elementor-overlay-no\" data-id=\"4755501\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-c962ac9\" data-id=\"c962ac9\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0e1b0b0 elementor-widget__width-initial elementor-widget elementor-widget-zermatt_core_button\" data-id=\"0e1b0b0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"zermatt_core_button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"qodef-shortcode qodef-m  qodef-button qodef-layout--filled  qodef-html--link qodef-text-hover\" href=\"tel:0293371136\" target=\"_self\"  style=\"padding: 66\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text-holder\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text\">CALL US<\/span>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text\">CALL US<\/span>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t<\/a>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1280e3a elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-widget-mobile__width-initial elementor-widget elementor-widget-zermatt_core_button\" data-id=\"1280e3a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"zermatt_core_button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"qodef-shortcode qodef-m  qodef-button qodef-layout--filled  qodef-html--link qodef-text-hover\" href=\"https:\/\/varautomotive.com.au\/sydney-car-service-booking\/\" target=\"_self\"  >\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text-holder\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text\">BOOK AN INSPECTION<\/span>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"qodef-m-text\">BOOK AN INSPECTION<\/span>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t<\/a>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re an Audi driver in Sydney, then you know that you have made a sound investment as Audi has always been known as a brand that creates high-quality vehicles that are known for their superior performance.&nbsp;
