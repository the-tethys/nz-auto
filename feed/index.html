style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover and Range Rover are two of the most iconic and well-known cars in the world, how well do you really know about them? In this article, we will detail Land Rover &amp; Range Rover’s origins, the company today, popular models and </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover servicing &amp; Range Rover servicing</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">. We will also cover some frequently asked questions from consumers about the two popular cars. </span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">So whether you are a current Land Rover or Range Rover owner looking for </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Range Rover service in Sydney</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> or a potential Land Rover or Range Rover owner, this article will answer all your questions.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Origins of Land Rover</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">From their humble beginnings as a sketch by Maurice Wilks, to becoming known for creating luxury SUV models that are perfect for tackling the wilderness or the concrete city jungle roads with family and friends, the history of Land Rover is an interesting one. Influenced largely by his experience with Jeeps and other vehicles on military duty overseas, the four wheel drive body style became a brand staple and even originally stuck with military colours for the first few models.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Land Rover series originally belonged to the Rover Company (British Leyland Motor Corporation) up until 1978, with the parent company later splitting and Land Rover falling under the British Aerospace ownership. In 1994, Land Rover was acquired by BMW, and then eventually sold to Ford. In 2004, Tata Motors acquired Land Rover and Jaguar from Ford. Over time the brand has had its transitions but it has still maintained its status as a luxurious and stylish SUV off-roader capable of anything.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Origins of Range Rover</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of the Land Rover heritage and legacy comes from the </span><a
href="https://varautomotive.com.au/range-rover-service-sydney/"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Range Rover</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, where the concept was started in 1969 and was named the ‘Range Rover Velar’. A year later the 3-Door Range Rover hit the market and received widespread critical acclaim being the first vehicle with permanent 4 Wheel Drive capabilities. In 1981, the 4-Door Range Rover was released, pushing the popularity of the brand to the next level. Now over 40 years later, the Range Rover continues to be a big player in the luxury SUV space and some even consider it a cultural icon.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Owning a Land Rover or Range Rove</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">r</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rovers are a popular and really sought after SUV for good reason. They have distinct style, incredible off-road and 4&#215;4 capabilities, luxury features and offer great comfort to drivers.</span></p><h3><b>Comfort and Luxury</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover&#8217;s are spacious and comfortable due to their high suspension and longer wheelbases, offering passengers more leg room when travelling over potholes or dips in the road or while enjoying a smooth ride with no bumps. They come with all the bells and whistles you would inspect from a luxury saloon or sports car while delivering the comfort of a SUV.</span></p><h3><b>Ease of Driving &amp; Off-Roading Capabilities</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Land Rover has always been known as a vehicle for those who lead an adventurous life. Its inception came from being designed to hit rough terrains and despite its luxuries, it retains the ability of dealing with obstacles both on and off the road.</span></p><h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Land Rover is a beast when it comes to performance. The luxury SUV has excellent acceleration and braking ability, beating out similar vehicles with top end speed as well as agile handling which are not often found in this market segment either.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The vehicle&#8217;s power train offers petrol or diesel options that provide enough torque off the line while still being able to retain respectable braking distances at high speeds, making these cars the perfect choices if you want more than just good looks but also power on-demand where needed.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Regular Land Rover Servicing and Range Rover Servicing</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">With regular </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">car servicing</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, your car will be more reliable and safe with the added benefit of financial savings in the form of the decreased replacement of major components and less overall wear and tear. With an improved fuel efficiency thanks to a healthy vehicle you can stretch those dollars even further &#8211; how good does that sound?</span></p><h3><b>Land Rover Service Sydney</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring you regularly book a </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover service in Sydney</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is crucial for the longevity of your vehicle, especially considering the size of Land Rover engines and the upkeep needed to maintain consistent performance. It is recommended to book your </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> every 6 months or 12,000kms (whichever comes first).</span></p><h3><b>Range Rover Service Sydney</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Just like other Land Rover models, the Range Rover servicing is no different. It is vital to have regular scheduled servicing to maintain your car&#8217;s optimum performance. By simply booking into a </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Range Rover servicing centre</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> every 6 months or 10,000kms (whichever comes first), you will ensure that your pride and joy is well maintained and any mechanical issues are fixed before they become much bigger and more expensive problems.</span></p><h3><b>A Typica</b><b>l </b><b>Land Rover Service &amp; Range Rover Service </b><b>Involves</b></h3><ul><li

style="font-weight: 400;">Due to recent changes to consumer law by the Department of Fair Trading, you are no longer obligated to use your dealership&#8217;s </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover service or Range Rover service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> while it is under warranty. You have the choice of choosing an independent </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover Specialist in Sydney</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> or an </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">independent Range Rover servicing centre</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> such as VAR Automotive.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that servicing performed at an </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">independent car servicing centre</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is more in depth and covers a wider scope than servicing provided at a dealership or by manufacturers. You will also receive more flexible options and better pricing and you will not void your manufacturer&#8217;s warranty.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover Range Rover Service at VAR Automotive</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">With their prestige and timeless heritage as an off-roader, Land Rover and Range Rovers are a go to choice for adventure seekers with luxury taste buds, however as with any vehicle, you must maintain a regular </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Land Rover service and Range Rover Service</span><span

style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of car brands on the market these days, but few have the longevity or prestige of BMW. With a rich history that stretches back to the early 20th century, BMW has become one of the top-selling automakers in the world. At </span><a
href="https://varautomotive.com.au/"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">VAR Automotive</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> we love driving BMWs as much as our expertly trained mechanics love servicing them. Let’s have a look at the origins of BMW, why they are such a prestigious and sought after brand of luxury vehicle, some of the most popular models and how to take care of your BMW including </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW servicing in Sydney</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Company Origins</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW&#8217;s origins can be traced back to 1916, making it over 100 years old with interesting origins  of facing tough trials and tribulations. Originally the company started as an aircraft engine manufacturer and was known as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werk. In July 1917, the company was renamed Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) and began producing motorcycles in 1920 before beginning producing automobiles in 1928.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">During the second world war and post-war years, the company’s focus shifted to supporting the war effort and was sent to the verge of bankruptcy after struggling to compete with the smaller and less expensive options provided by Volkswagen. Thankfully, in 1959, German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt gained independent control of BMW, by purchasing 50% equity in the company. He soon developed and released the BMW 700 which was instrumental in pushing the company into profitability.</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 1960s, BMW continued to lean into the luxury and sports-oriented car market by adding coupe and luxury sedan models into their range. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupes in 1976, the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978, and also releasing their first official M-badged car at the Paris Motorshow in the same year.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW Today</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the BMW Group, consists of four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad (BMW’s Motorcycle brand), and is the world&#8217;s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles with a strong focus on innovation and sustainability throughout the production process.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, with 31 facilities across 15 countries as well as an international sales network that extends into more than 140 nations worldwide, the BMW Group is a global leader in innovation while also seeking out new ways to be sustainable without sacrificing quality or prestige. This quest for innovation and sustainability has led to improvements to continuously reduce fuel consumption while simultaneously increasing emissions standards through the use of ecologically friendly technologies such as renewable energy sources or recycled materials during manufacturing processes.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Models</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW offers a wide range of vehicles, from sedans and convertibles to SUVs, sports cars and motorcycles. Some of their most popular models include the BMW 3 Series, the BMW M Series, and the BMW X Series.</span></p><h3><b>BMW 3 Series</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The BMW 3 Series has been a favourite for its versatility with models that range from the classic sedan to wagons marketed as Touring, Coupé or Cabrio &#8211; it&#8217;s no wonder this car strikes an appropriate balance between agility, functionality and safety features while still being popular with all age groups.</span></p><h3><b>BMW M Series</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The M-family is an iconic series that has long been associated with high performance and exclusivity. The current model range includes the following: BMW M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8 and a few other variants.</span></p><h3><b>BMW X Series</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The BMW X Series is the ultimate SUV line-up. With sporty and distinctive designs, these SUVs will be sure to stand out and are manufactured with the driver in mind. The impressive driving performance that comes with the premium feature set ensures they&#8217;re more than just an ordinary addition for those who love taking land journeys in style. The current model range includes X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 and X7.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW Servicing Sydney</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Owning ‘The Ultimate Driving Machine’ means that you need to take good care of your pride and joy so that it can take good care of you on the road. Although BMW is known for its reliability, it is so important to get a </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> from a reputable BMW trained and authorised mechanic who only uses genuine parts. By ensuring your BMW is regularly serviced, your pride and joy will continue to perform the way it was designed to and will be a pleasure to drive.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span

style="font-weight: 400;"> typically involves; an oil service, brake pads and disc checks and other procedures, clutch service, suspension and steering check, battery check and replacement, wiper blade replacement, air conditioning service and repairs, electrical service, diagnosis and vehicle scans as required by the manufacturer logbook and servicing schedule specific to your model.</span></p><h3><b>How do I know when I need to book a BMW Service?</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW recommends a basic </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">BMW service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> once a year or every 15,000 kilometres (whichever comes first), with servicing recommended more often if your vehicle is often driven under strenuous conditions.</span></p><p><span

style="font-weight: 400;">The Volkswagen brand is a household name the world over and often conjures up images of small prestige Euro cars that can pack a punch. Let us take a comprehensive look at Volkswagen and everything this European powerhouse has to offer, including; the company origins, the benefits of owning a Volkswagen, popular models and </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen servicing</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason it is referred to as ‘The People’s Car’ as they have something to offer everyone, from small commuter cars to high performance cars for those seeking thrills. If you are a proud Volkswagen owner, keep reading as we will provide you with all the important information to keep your beloved vehicle in top notch condition.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Origins of Volkswagen</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen Group is a major German automobile manufacturer that was founded by the German Government in 1937 to produce an affordable car for everyone. Their headquarters are based out of Wolfsburg, Germany where they have been doing business since 1948 and producing cars for over 70 years!</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Production for Volkswagen expanded quickly through the 1950s when it introduced the iconic ‘Transporter Van’ and Beetle. As competition increased domestically and internationally, Volkswagen made the move to small cars with a more modern design that had the engine in the front of the car, this gave rise to the ever so popular Volkswagen Golf, with the Golf becoming an instant success across the globe and a worldwide best seller.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen has since expanded their line introducing the Passat shortly after, the even smaller Polo model, Tiguan SUV and the Caddy van. In 1975, the company established the GTI line that catered to car enthusiasts who were seeking a little more zip in their daily commuter. Following the success of the GTI line, Volkswagen developed the R range which took performance to the next level, putting the Volkswagen Golf in competition with some serious sports cars such as BMW and Mercedes.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Following its world wide success, the Volkswagen company ultimately became the Volkswagen group now comprising ten brands which include: Volkswagen, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, SKODA, SEAT, CUPRA, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche and Ducati.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">(That’s an impressive list of car brands, if we do say ourselves)</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">So what makes Volkswagen cars so great?</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Owning a Volkswagen</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, </span><a
href="https://varautomotive.com.au/volkswagen-service-sydney/"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> is not referred to as ‘The People’s Car’ without reason, and boasts a number of prestigious accolades throughout its history including winning countless ‘Car of the Year’ awards since their inception. With this in mind, let’s have a look at some of the many benefits of owning a Volkswagen.</span></p><h3><b>High Quality Build</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a car that will stand the test of time due to its high-quality then look no further than Volkswagen. Volkswagen have been manufacturing great models for many decades now and are well known for having vehicles on the road well after production has ended. Some examples include the Beetle, Kombi van and Golf. It goes without saying how durable these cars are since most people consider them timeless classics &#8211; perfect if your goal also includes owning a classic that performs.</span></p><h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Amongst their daily commuters, Volkswagen provides thrill seekers the options to have sophistication and sports performance in one car. The Volkswagen R Range has a powerful turbocharged petrol engine under the hood, offering outstanding power and torque as well as luxury and comfort at the same time.</span></p><h3><b>Great Resale Value</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">With great build quality and performance comes great resale value. Volkswagens are notorious for their ability to hold their value on the used car market which is a great plus for any owner regardless of how long they have owned their car for. So when it is time to let your Volkswagen go, you know you will be in a good position to sell and upgrade to the latest model.</span></p><h3><b>Reliability</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">With Volkswagens being in production since the early 1900s you can feel assured that you are in a reliable and time tested vehicle. Think of this &#8211; Volkswagen&#8217;s engines were even used in the military! That&#8217;s true reliability. It is often said that if a Volkswagen engine receives the car servicing and auto repairs it requires it could last a lifetime, which leads to an important question. What does </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen servicing in Sydney</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> involve?</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen Service</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Just like anything else, it is important to take good care of your Volkswagen by taking it in for a regular </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> at an authorised </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen service centre</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">. A regular </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> ensures that your car is performing at its best and will reduce the likelihood of expensive problems or repairs for you down the line.</span></p><h3><b>A Typical</b> <b>Volkswagen Service in Sydney</b><b> Involves</b></h3><ul><li

style="font-weight: 400;">– a car with regular log book servicing is always appealable to a buyer which means your car will be valued higher</span></li></ul><h3><b>Independent Logbook Servicing</b><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">There is an outdated myth that you must take your car to a Volkswagen dealership to have your </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen service</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> done, or you will void your warranty, thankfully this is not the case and you can take your car to an </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">independent Volkswagen service centre</span><span

style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that servicing performed at independent car servicing centres are more in depth and cover a wider scope than servicing provided at a dealership or manufacturers. You will also receive more flexible options and better pricing.</span></p><h2><span

style="font-weight: 400;">For many Sydney-siders our cars mean the world to us, whether you need a car for work, your daily commute, to carry the family around or you simply enjoy the rumble of your car&#8217;s engine and taking it for a joy ride. Living in Sydney, it almost feels like a necessity to have a car, however, owning and making sure your car is in a reliable state can feel like a daunting task especially for European and prestige cars.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a
href="https://varautomotive.com.au/"><span
style="font-weight: 400;">VAR Automotive</span></a><span
style="font-weight: 400;">, servicing and maintaining prestigious European vehicles is our favourite thing to do, so let us discuss the different types of </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">car servicing and auto repairs</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> you might need to ensure your car is ready to take on whatever life throws your way and so you can enjoy it to the fullest.</span></p><h2><span
style="font-weight: 400;">European &amp; Prestige Car Servicing</span></h2><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">European and prestige cars are sought after by many in Sydney. The combination of performance, style, luxury and comfort are all features that give European cars their reputation, however, they come with a downside &#8211; finding a quality </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">European car servicing centre</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> can be difficult.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">European cars are manufactured and built differently to domestic vehicles and often require mechanics to undertake specialised training to ensure the car servicing is completed correctly, and often required the use of specialised tools. This training and associated specialty tools are often expensive and difficult to acquire for the regular mechanic or service technician.</span></p><h3><b>Independent Logbook Servicing</b></h3><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">A logbook service is an important part of </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">European car servicing</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> and is generally performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications. </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Independent logbook services</span><span
style="font-weight: 400;"> are documented, which is important to maintain consistency with servicing and ensure your car mechanic can keep track of what procedures have been performed. </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Independent Logbook Servicing </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">also preserves your car’s warranty which is crucial for any European or prestige car owner.</span></p><p><b>Popular European car and prestige cars brands include:</b></p><ul><li

class="elementor-widget-container"><p>If you are a Mercedes car lover, then you know that regular servicing and maintenance from Mercedes mechanics in Sydney is essential in keeping your vehicle looking great, running smoothly like a dream and in tip top condition. In this article, we will discuss the importance of regular Mercedes servicing and auto repairs, as well as some of the basics to check in between service intervals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Benefits of Owning a Mercedes</h2><p>There are a number of benefits and pleasure that come with owning a Mercedes vehicle with just a few of these being prestige, luxury, performance, ability to last and exceptional safety.</p><p><strong>Prestige</strong></p><p>There’s no denying it, owning a Mercedes is a status symbol and if you’re a person who enjoys the finer things in life, the prestige of owning a Mercedes will have heads turning your way for all the right reasons. There are a number of factors that make Mercedes cars so prestigious; Firstly, they are known for their luxury and high-end features such as interior trimmings and sleek outside style. Secondly, Mercedes cars are often associated with wealth and success. Finally, Mercedes cars have a reputation for being well-made and reliable, which contributes to their overall prestige.</p><p><strong>Luxury and Performance</strong></p><p>There are a number of reasons why Mercedes cars are known for their luxury and performance. Firstly, they are built with high-quality materials and components that help to ensure a smooth and comfortable ride. Secondly, Mercedes cars feature a number of cutting-edge technologies that provide excellent performance on the road. Finally, these cars also boast impressive levels of safety and security, which is another key factor in their performance and popularity making Mercedes cars some of the most sought-after vehicles on the market today.</p><p><strong>Built to Last</strong></p><p>Being built with high-quality materials and components, Mercedes are built to last and can provide years of enjoyable driving experiences. Mercedes cars can have life spans of close to 300,000 kilometres without major incident, especially when serviced on schedule and regularly by a highly trained and Mercedes authorised mechanic in Sydney.</p><p><strong>Safety</strong></p><p>Mercedes has been a brand that has always been at the forefront of automotive safety and innovation, and this has been even more so in recent times with the evolution of driver assisting technologies. With this commitment to ongoing safety innovations, you and your passengers can feel safer when in a Mercedes vehicle.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Logbook Servicing &amp; Schedule</h2><p>Regularly servicing your Mercedes vehicle by Mercedes specialists in the Eastern Suburbs has a number of benefits with the official Mercedes service schedule being designed to help keep your Mercedes running smoothly and efficiently, looking great ensuring longevity. Having your Mercedes service in the Eastern Suburbs on a regular basis by a trained and authorised Mercedes mechanics technician will help ensure that components that will wear out will be replaced before this happens (e.g. timing belts), and any other mechanical problems can be identified early on before they have a chance to cause major damage or breakdown.</p><p>Depending on the model of Mercedes that you own, the service schedule differs with some of the recommended servicing schedules per model listed below;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>G Professionals &#8211; should be serviced every 10,000 kilometres or one year (whichever comes first)</li><li>G-Wagon (non-AMG) and AMG65 and 600 variants &#8211; should be serviced every 15,000 kilometres or one year (whichever comes first)</li><li>AMG 45 and 63 variants &#8211; should be serviced very 20,000 kilometres or one year (whichever comes first)</li><li>All other models including; AMG 35, 43 and 53 variants &#8211; should be serviced every 25,000 kilometres or one year (whichever comes first)</li></ul><p>Of Course there are other factors that may influence how often you need Mercedes auto repairs such as; how frequently it is driven, whether the vehicle is often driven under more stressful mechanical conditions e.g. heavy stop-start traffic and whether there are any signs of mechanical issues that may manifest into bigger issues.</p><p>There are a number of benefits of having your Mercedes regularly looked at by Mercedes mechanics in Sydney and maintaining the logbook servicing schedule, with these including;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>Increased safety &#8211; with basic safety features such as tyres, brakes and windscreen wipers being regularly inspected, any minor issues with these can be picked up before they become a bigge safety issue</li><li>Enhanced performance &#8211; well looked after components such as fuel filters, spark plugs and timing belts will improve overall vehicle performance.&nbsp;</li><li>Improved fuel efficiency &#8211; a smoother running engine will lead to an improved fuel economy and who doesn’t want to save money on fuel these days?</li><li>Financial savings &#8211; nipping small mechanical issues in the bud before they become bigger issues and possibly impact multiple components will save money on more expensive repairs in the long run</li><li>Higher resale value &#8211; a well maintained vehicle will have a higher resale value than one that is not as well maintained or have a regular service log</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Checking The Basics</h2><p>Checking the basics in between Mercedes service Eastern Suburbs intervals can not only improve the performance of your vehicle, however it can minimise wear and tear on major components and improve their life. Some of the basics that we at VAR recommend checking in between service intervals are;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oil Level</strong></h3><p>By checking the oil level, you will know before your oil level reaches a critically low level which may compromise engine components if otherwise left unchecked. When checking the oil level, it is important to do so with the vehicle on a flat surface and when the engine is cool. Another tip is to occasionally check the ground under where your vehicle is noramly parked and if there are oil spots that is a sure sign of an oil leak which is a serious issue.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tyres</strong></h3><p>Regularly checking tyres is not only imperative for safety, however if there are any signs that they are wearing unevenly, this is an indication that they have become non-aligned which can have major impacts on the steering and suspension systems. Another important thing, is to regularly check tyre pressure to ensure this is correct to ensure that they are performing optimally and as a bonus this will have an improvement on fuel efficiency.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cooling Systems</strong></h3><p>Keeping an eye on your vehicle&#8217;s cooling system is a fairly simple task and can save a lot of stress in the event something was to go wrong. Once in a while have a look at the radiator fluid level and if this is low, generally it can be topped up with water (if using a long life coolant), and this can be changed on your next service preventing any overheating situations.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>Mercedes vehicles can be an absolute pleasure to drive, and the better they are maintained, the better the driving experience will be. Proper maintenance will prolong the longevity of the Mercedes and will provide a better resale value when you eventually choose to upgrade. For all your Mercedes servicing and repairs in Sydney contact us at VAR Automotive today and know that your beloved Mercedes is in good hands with our authorised and highly trained technicians.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section

class="elementor-widget-container"><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Pink Slip</h2><p>In NSW it is a legal requirement for all vehicles more than 5 years old to undergo a safety inspection every 12 months, which is known as a pink slip inspection or Safety Check. A pink slip inspection is a basic maintenance check that ensures your vehicle meets certain safety criteria and is deemed to be roadworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>At VAR Automotive, we are an RMS Authorised Inspection Station (AIS) and undertake numerous pink slip inspections in the Eastern Suburbs on a daily basis. With our knowledge and expertise, let us share with you as to why pink slips in NSW are important, what is involved in an Safety Check Inspection and why it is best to not be caught driving without a valid pink slip in NSW.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Are Pink Slips Important</h2><p>Pink Slips and e-safety inspections are important in ensuring that the vehicle of every road user in NSW meets the same basic safety criteria, meaning safer roads for all road users including drivers, passengers and pedestrians alike. This gives peace of mind to road users who know that there are less likely to be other vehicles on the road with mechanical problems that could become a safety issue or cause harm for them or their passengers in the event of an accident.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Involved During a Pink Slip Inspection</h2><p>During a pink slip inspection, your RMS authorised technician will check a number of areas of your vehicle looking for anything that could potentially have a negative impact on road safety. This check will involve a number of visual and physical inspection which will include checking;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>Tyre quality and tread depth &#8211; these will be checked for evenness of wear, punctures and visible damage and to ensure there is enough tread on the tyres so they can function properly.</li><li>Vehicle body condition &#8211; the body will be checked for any signs of damage or sharp edges that could cause further injury in the event of an accident. This includes rust, broken and loose panels among other items.</li><li>Working electrics and lights &#8211; indicator lights, brake lights and headlights will be checked to ensure that they are working properly.</li><li>Seat Belts &#8211; these will be checked to ensure that they lock into position under certain speed and force and that there are no visible signs of damage.</li><li>Engine and driveline and fluid leaks &#8211; fluid levels such as brake fluid and radiator fluid will be checked to ensure that there are no major leaks that can reduce vehicle safety.</li><li>Brake efficiency: brakes will be checked to ensure that they meet a specified criteria at being able to stop in a certain distance at a certain speed, as well as being inspected for any damage or rust.</li><li>Windscreen wipers &#8211; will be checked to ensure that they are clearing water off the windscreen to maintain visibility and that the water jets are working.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition to the visual checks by our authorised inspectors, your vehicle will be checked on our state-of-the-art diagnostic machine “Safe-T-Stop”. It is an electronically accurate PlateTronic® equipment approved by RMS, which not only checks the braking system, but also the suspension and much more. It is a test you can trust, and you will even get a printout of the vehicle’s performance.</p><p>If any of the inspected items during a pink slip inspection are not up to standard and failed, this will require the issue to be rectified prior to a re-inspection taking place.If any of these items are not up to standard, the mechanic will fail your vehicle. This means that you will need to make repairs before your vehicle can be legally driven on the road again.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other Registration Tips</h2><p>There are a few other tips that will ensure your pink slip service in the Eastern Suburbs will go as smoothly as possible, with less potential for failed items and other tips throughout the registration process.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How much does a pink slip inspection cost?</strong></h2><p>How much does a pink slip inspection cost? This is a common question and the answer is that the cost of a pink slip inspection is standardised across NSW, however will vary depending on the type of vehicle in which you require an inspection for. The below tables summarise the different classes of vehicle and the costs associated with each;</p><figure
class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Inspection type</strong></td><td><strong>Total fee (inc. GST)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Light vehicle</td><td>$42</td></tr><tr><td>Motorcycle</td><td>$24</td></tr><tr><td>Trailer without brakes</td><td>$22</td></tr><tr><td>Trailer with brakes</td><td>$33</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Failed Safety Checks</strong></h2><p>If your vehicle fails a safety check, you need to make the repairs before you can renew registration. If you complete the repairs within 14 days and take the vehicle to be reassessed at the same authorised inspection station, no extra inspection fees apply. If you repair the vehicle after the 14 day period ends, you need to pay another inspection fee. Once the repairs have been made and your vehicle passes the safety check, you can renew your registration online.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fines</strong></h2><p>The fine in NSW for driving an unregistered vehicle that has not passed a pink slip inspection in the required time is $1,487 and a loss of 4 demerit points. With the high-tech number plate detection cameras on every highway patrol car in NSW (which detects unregistered vehicles), it is not advisable to try your luck in driving a vehicle that has not passed inspection.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this this there are a number of fines in place if you happen to be caught driving with a failed e-safety inspection item (this is regardless of whether you still have valid registration), for example brake lights not working, indicator lights not working and not having sufficient tyre tread are just a few examples.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Valid CTP Policy</strong></h2><p>Prior to being able to re-register your vehicle with the NSW RMS, you will need to have an up-to-date comprehensive third party (CTP) insurance policy. This policy covers medical costs to individuals (other than the driver) who are injured in the event of an accident, including passengers and pedestrians. Once you have a valid CTP policy in place and have passed the pink slip service in the Eastern Suburbs you will be able to renew your registration.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Prepare For Your Safety Check Inspection</strong></h2><p>There are a few things you can do to make sure your vehicle is ready for a pink slip inspection. Firstly, check your tyre pressure and tread depth. Secondly, make sure all of your lights are working properly. Thirdly, ensure that your windscreen wipers are in good condition. Fourthly, give your car a good clean inside and out &#8211; this will help your authorised inspector to spot potential problems more easily. Lastly, if you are aware of any reason why your vehicle might fail inspection, let your authorised inspector know as these can often be rectified and save the time of failing an inspection.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>If you’re in need of a pink slip inspection in the Eastern Suburbs, don’t risk letting yourself get caught out and potentially paying the price for driving an unregistered vehicle. Contact us at VAR Automotive and as an authorised inspection station we will carry out your inspection without hassle so you can continue enjoying the roads.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section

class="elementor-widget-container"><p>If you&#8217;re an Audi driver in Sydney, then you know that you have made a sound investment as Audi has always been known as a brand that creates high-quality vehicles that are known for their superior performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Audi cars are built well and last longer than other brands because they&#8217;re so reliable; if you drive your Audi regularly then it will probably go further without needing any Audi repairs in Sydney (or at least not having major ones), however it is still important to maintain your car with regular Audi servicing in Sydney.</p><p>At VAR Automotive we take pride and care in every single Audi vehicle that we service, so let&#8217;s have a look at some of the benefits of owning an Audi vehicle, as well as some of the more common maintenance issues, and the benefits of a regular Audi logbook service in Sydney with us at VAR.</p><p>The Benefits of Owning an Audi</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Quality And Durability</strong></h3><p>Audi’s are known for their quality and are built not only with performance and comfort in mind, however are built with strength and durability in mind, so Audi owners can rest assured that their car will last the distance with minimal issues when maintained correctly by Audi mechanics in Sydney.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Performance</strong></h3><p>Audi’s are known for their great performance on the road. They handle well, have plenty of power and are efficient too, meaning you can get from A to B quickly and without spending a lot of money on petrol. Audi drivers always enjoy a good driving experience especially when mainatiend with a regular Audi car service.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Style And Fashion</strong></h3><p>Excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail are what make Audi vehicles so special. They&#8217;re designed with the driver&#8217;s comfort in mind, from their luxurious leather seats to their spacious interiors that provide plenty of room for passengers too!&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safety</strong></h3><p>The safety performance of Audi cars is excellent, with many of the brand&#8217;s models being five-star rated for their safety features and include a number of the more modern safety features including lane departure warnings and electronic driver assist.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fuel Economy</strong></h3><p>The fuel economy on Audi cars is great, saving the owner a good bit of money in the long run. With an average fuel economy of 9.8 litres per 100 kilometres for an Audi Q7 SUV, this delivers both high performance and high efficiency.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expense</strong></h3><p>Audi cars generally aren&#8217;t particularly expensive to maintain when compared with other luxury car brands. However, it&#8217;s still important to stick to the manufacturer&#8217;s servicing recommendations and Audi car service in order to ensure your car remains in top condition with components replaced as per the manufacturer logbook recommendations.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common Audi Problems</h2><p>Even though Audi’s are built with reliability and durability in mind, as with any other make of vehicle they are prone to a number of the more common mechanical issues that occur over time and will require Audi mechanics in Sydney, these include;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transmission</strong></h3><p>Audi cars have been known to suffer from faulty transmissions from time to time, which can result in them not going into gear properly or even stalling at low speeds. This problem is more prevalent in older makes and models, however it&#8217;s still important that you get your newer model Audi checked out if there are any signs of trouble with shifting between gears (such as hesitation). If left unchecked this kind of fault could lead to major damage and need Audi mechanics in Sydney, over time so make sure you keep an eye out for signs of early transmission problems such as jerking motions while driving or grinding noises.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Electrical</strong></h3><p>Electrical faults are also quite common with Audi cars, and they can range from minor issues like dashboard warning lights coming on to more significant problems such as the engine cutting out completely while driving. If you experience any kind of electrical problem with your Audi and if you are in need of Audi repairs in Sydney or if any warning lights come on that indicate an electrical problem, it is best to contact us at VAR Automotive for diagnosis and repair as soon as possible.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Airbags</strong></h3><p>Another common issue with Audi cars is faulty airbags, which can cause them to not deploy correctly in the event of an accident. If your Audi has been recalled for this reason, it&#8217;s important to get it fixed as soon as possible as an undeployed airbag could lead to serious injury in the event of a crash. At VAR Automotive we can inspect your airbags for any signs of damage and proper function and replace them as needed.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Timing Belt</strong></h3><p>Eventually, wear and tear will deteriorate the timing belt leading to it working less efficiently than it should, with this potentially putting excess stress on other parts and leading to their deterioration. If you notice that there is a ticking noise coming from the engine area, or your car is revving differently to normal, you may be in need of Audi mechanics in Sydney &#8211; time to bring your Audi into us for an inspection!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oil Leaks</strong></h3><p>As with any other type of vehicle, Audi engines can sometimes leak oil and the sooner this issue is diagnosed and fixed the less potential damage will occur to other parts of the vehicle. If you notice that there are spots of oil on your driver or where you normally park your Audi, or if the oil warning light comes on, it is time to book in your Audi car service with us to prevent further possible damage.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Regular Audi Service</h3><p>As with any vehicle brand, make, or model, it&#8217;s important to maintain your Audi by having regular logbook servicing and preventative maintenance undertaken in accordance with the Audi manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations. This ensures that everything is working as it should be and helps avoid problems later down the track which could&nbsp; prove to be costly. Maintaining the Audi logbook service schedule is a good way of keeping track of when your car needs servicing and what other Audi repairs might need doing in the future such as brake pad replacement or transmission repair.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Often Should You Have Your Audi Serviced?</strong></h2><p>This depends on the make and model of your Audi, as well as how often you drive it. Generally speaking, Audi’s fixed service intervals are based on an average driving period of approximately 15,000km per year. Therefore a scheduled Audi car service is due every 12 months or 15,000km’s (whichever occurs first). However, if there are any signs of problems between recommended service intervals, or you are constantly driving under exhaustive conditions such as heavy city driving, it would be advisable to have your Audi serviced on a more regular basis.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Benefits of a Regular Audi Service</strong></h2><p>There are a number of benefits of regularly servicing your Audi vehicle, these include;</p><p>&#8211; A smoother and more enjoyable driving experience for you</p><p>&#8211; An improved fuel economy, meaning less money spent at the petrol station</p><p>&#8211; Increased safety on the road as well as peace of mind knowing that your vehicle is in good condition</p><p>&nbsp;&#8211; An extended lifespan with your Audi vehicle running smoother and for longer</p><p>&nbsp;&#8211; Piece of mind knowing that your Audi is in good working mechanical condition</p><p>&nbsp;&#8211; Your are less likely to suffer a frustrating breakdown if your Audi is regularly maintained and in good condition</p><p>&nbsp;&#8211; Maintained value and a higher resale value when it comes time to upgrade to the newest Audi model</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Audi Servicing at VAR Automotive</h2><p>Here at our VAR workshop, we have a team of qualified mechanics in Sydney who are experts in all things Audi with over 20 years experience servicing Audi’s so whether you need a logbook service, some basic preventative maintenance or some extensive repairs done, contact us today to book in your next Audi car service and rest assured your car is in good hands.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section

class="elementor-widget-container"><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Blue Slip?</h2><p>A blue slip inspection, also known as an Authorised Unregistered Vehicle Inspection (AUVI) report is a form of registration required by the NSW Roads and Maritimes Services (RMS), for unregistered vehicles. RMS blue slip inspections are not to be confused with other types of registration slips that are required by the NSW RMS at various other times including a pink slip/ e-Safety check which is a basic check for roadworthiness and a green slip which is compulsory third party insurance and a requirement for registration.</p><p>Read on to learn about when you need a blue slip, what is undertaken and checked during an RMS blue slip inspection, and the difference between a pink slip and blue slip and where to get a blue slip service in the Eastern Suburbs.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Do You Need a Blue Slip?</h2><p>In NSW a blue slip inspection is required in a number of different situations to ensure roadworthiness and safety of a vehicle with the inspection being more thorough and rigorous than a standard e-Safety check. A blue slip inspection will be required in one of the following circumstances;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expired Registration</strong></h3><p>When a vehicle’s registration has expired and the vehicle has not been registered for a period of time of three months or longer, a blue slip inspection will need to be completed to ensure that the vehicle is still in a roadworthy condition and safe to drive.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interstate of Overseas</strong></h3><p>Vehicles that have been imported from overseas or interstate and are to be registered in NSW will need to undergo a blue slip inspection, with a blue slip inspection needing to be undertaken within two weeks of the vehicle entering the state. This is to ensure that the vehicle complies with the strict NSW safety standards and is in good repair.condition</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Number Plates</strong></h3><p>When a vehicle needs to be registered and it has no number plates &#8211; which indicates that it has been unregistered for some time or has not been on the road, a blue slip inspection and identity and design check is required to ensure that all original parts are on the vehicle, such as the engine, have been legitimately sourced and that the vehicle itself has not previously been written off, stolen, or involved in fraudulent activity.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Written Off Vehicles</strong></h3><p>When a vehicle has previously been written off by an insurance company this signifies that significant damage has occured to the vehicle and a blue slip inspection will be needed to ensure that the vehicle is safe as well as an identity and design check to ensure original components of the vehicle such as the engine are still in place or if changed that they have been legitimately repurposed.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Significant Vehicle Changes</strong></h3><p>When significant modifications or repairs have been undertaken to any given vehicle, an RMS blue slip inspection is required to ensure that all vehicle modifications or repairs have been undertaken in accordance with RMS laws and to ensure vehicle safety. A design and identity check will also confirm that the parts used in any major vehicle modifications have been legally acquired and not previously been reported as stolen or illegally repurposed.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Police Defects</strong></h3><p>If you have been unlucky enough to receive a defect notice from the New South Wales Police for any reason, this defect notice will need to be cleared prior to the vehicle being considered to be legally roadworthy again. A blue slip inspection will need to be undertaken to ensure that the defect has been rectified.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Checked During a Blue Slip Inspection</h2><p>During a typical blue slip inspection and service in the Eastern Suburbs, the following items will be checked to ensure that your vehicle is roadworthy and in good repair;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>Brakes</li><li>Suspension and steering</li><li>Lights</li><li>Seat belt functions</li><li>Major and minor leaks</li><li>Tyres and wheels</li><li>Engine/Engine components</li><li>Exhaust system</li><li>Towing attachments (if any)</li><li>The overall physical condition for your vehicle</li><li>Full design check</li><li>Making sure there are no illegal/dangerous extensions and accessories fitted (example, light bard, a spotlight, rod holders, etc..)</li><li>Body rust</li></ul><p>In addition to the above checks carried out by VAR Automotive’s expert and authorised inspectors, your vehicle’s safety check will be also carried out on our state-of-the-art diagnostic machine “Safe-T-Stop” – electronically accurate PlateTronic<sup>®</sup> equipment approved by RMS, which not only checks the braking system but also the suspension and much more.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Difference Between a Blue And Pink Slip</h2><p>With so many different coloured slips being required by the NSW RMS for the various types of vehicle registrations needed, this can sometimes become a little confusing, so let us summarise the difference between a blue slip and a pink slip and a green slip;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Green Slip</strong></h2><p>This is a Compulsory Third Party Insurance (CTP) insurance policy that must be taken out prior to a vehicle being able to be registered. CTP insurance covers compensation payments for people injured or killed in a motor vehicle accident.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pink Slip/ e-safety Inspection</strong></h2><p>This is a safety inspection report issued by an authorised inspection station, such a Vaucluse Auto Repairs to prove that a vehicle has passed the required roadworthy standards for registration. Vehicles more than 5 years old require a safety inspection as a condition of registration renewal.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blue Slip Inspection</strong></h2><p>This is a safety inspection report issued by Service NSW to prove that a vehicle has passed the required roadworthy, design and identity standards for registration. You will need an RMS blue slip inspection in the following circumstances: Interstate transfers,Vehicles that have run out of registration, or vehicles that have been imported.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is The Cost of An RMS Blue Slip Inspection</h2><p>The cost of a blue slip inspection and identity and design check will vary depending on the type of vehicle that you intent on having inspected, prices are correct as of February 2022;</p><figure
class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Inspection Type</td><td>Total fee (inc. GST)</td></tr><tr><td>Light vehicle</td><td>$67</td></tr><tr><td>Motorcycle</td><td>$41</td></tr><tr><td>Trailer without brakes</td><td>$34</td></tr><tr><td>Trailer with brakes</td><td>$48</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>How long does it take for a blue slip inspection will depend on the following factors;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>If its a light vehicle, heavy vehicle, motorbike or a trailer</li><li>If its imported vehicle from another country</li><li>Modified and non-standard vehicles</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blue Slip Inspections at VAR</h2><p>At VAR Automotive we are an Authorised Unregistered Vehicle Inspection station (AUVI), and as such are able to issue Blue Slips, Clear Defect Notices and electronically submit your RMS blue slip inspection report which is valid for 42 days from the date of issue.

class="elementor-widget-container"><p>As we should all know the importance of a regular visit to the doctors if for no other reason than just a quick check up to ensure our bodies are working as they should and everything is in order, the same can be said for our car. Having a regular service and car repairs is oftentimes overlooked and forgotten for a number of reasons such as; time, the thought of the cost of a service and possible auto repairs in Sydney, convenience, and just thinking that it is not that important and can wait.</p><p>The simple truth is that the longer a service or inspection is put off, the more likely it is that minor issues that could be easily fixed turn into bigger and more expensive car repairs that can affect the safety of your car or leave you stuck on the side of the road. Replacing a radiator at the first sign of a leak from a crack is much cheaper and convenient than having this problem manifest and the radiator overheat leaving you stuck on the side of the road and overheated yourself!</p><p>Every make and model of vehicle is different and as such will have different maintenance requirements and schedules which should be followed to ensure optimum mechanical performance in order to ensure manufacturers warranties are not voided. Regardless of vehicle make, model, and manufacturer recommendations, it is universally accepted that at a minimum, a car should be serviced every 6 months or 10,000 kilometres (whichever comes first), though this may be sooner depending on the type of driving that you do.</p><p>At VAR Automotive, we believe that there are a number of benefits of a regular service, and car repairs will keep your car in tip top shape and the experience of a service is neither as expensive or inconvenient as many people believe. We also believe that there are a number of basic preventative maintenance tasks that can be undertaken between auto repair services to ensure optimum performance for your car.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of a Regular Service</h2><p>There are a number of benefits of a regular service, these include;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New Car Warranty</strong></h3><p>All new cars will come with a new car warranty, and more often than not part of the conditions of keeping this warranty is following the service and maintenance schedule recommended by the manufacturer (this is crucial in the event you need to make a claim for repairs under warranty). At VAR Automotive, luxury car auto repair shop, we are licensed to carry out independent logbook servicing on almost all makes and models of car, this will not only protect your new car warranty, however is cheaper than expensive dealership servicing.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Early Diagnosis</strong></h3><p>Just like with a regular trip to the doctor and a routine blood test, a regular inspection and auto repair service of your vehicle can potentially find and diagnose small mechanical issues that can be fixed before becoming much larger issues that can affect other parts of your vehicle and potentially leave you stranded on the side of the road.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safety</strong></h3><p>During a regular inspection and auto repair service, your fully trained VAR technician will undertake a safety check and look for any damage or wear and tear to components that may cause safety problems. This includes inspecting, cleaning, and replacing brakes and brake components as needed as well as checking the tyres and wheel alignment.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lower Running Costs</strong></h3><p>The sooner that any minor issues can be diagnosed and corrected this will stop bigger problems from occurring and ultimately will save on maintenance and running costs over the lifetime of your vehicle. Things such as replacing spark plugs before the end of their life can have a major impact on engine performance and reduce the strain on other components.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple tip from us at VAR Automotive, is to always keep your fuel level at minimum of a quarter tank full, this way the fuel system will be taking in cleaner fuel that sits higher in the tank as opposed to the fuel at the bottom of the tank when near empty where any fuel sediment will be sitting towards the bottom of the tank (this will prevent constantly replacing fuel filters and is better for the engine).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Maintain Vehicle Value</strong></h3><p>There is a noticeable difference between the performance of a vehicle that has been well maintained and one that has not been, and the one that has been well maintained will always have a higher resale value than the one that has not. At VAR Automotive, not only can we regularly maintain and service your vehicle ensuring optimum performance, when it comes time to upgrade, we can help you get the best possible resale value for your previously loved pride and joy with our buy and sell.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventative Maintenance</h2><p>There are a number of minor, preventative maintenance tasks that can be undertaken between services to ensure the optimal running of your car, less wear and tear and increasing the longevity of components thus ensuring vehicle safety is maintained and can save on car repairs in The Eastern Suburbs for your next service, these include;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tyres and Tyre Pressure</strong></h3><p>As we have covered in a previous blog post about the importance of a regular tyre inspection and service, to ensure optimal tyre performance, vehicle safety and longevity of the tyres, they should be checked or any signs of damage on a regular basis. It is also important to ensure that the tyre pressure is regularly checked and adjusted based on weight variances (for example tyre pressure will need to be adjusted for towing of trailers and caravans etc).</p><p>We recommend that tyre pressure is checked at a minimum every second time in which you fuel up, and where practical try and check the tyre pressure as close to home as possible when the tyres are cooler as the warmer they are the higher the tyre pressure reading will be and this may mean that the air pressure is not filled up to the correct level.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Engine Fluids</strong></h3><p>Even with the sensors and warning indicators that modern cars have to sense and alert you of any low fluid levels, it is still good practice to give the fluid levels a good old fashioned look over once in a while (before any low level fluid indicators appear).&nbsp;</p><p>Have a quick look at engine coolant levels, most cars today have a long life engine coolant and if the fluid is little on the low side this can be topped up with a little bit of water until the next service.</p><p>Check the engine oil level and if this is on the low side, top this up with a small amount of the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended oil, we also would recommend adding a small amount of new oil every few months regardless of the level being low, as this will freshen up the older oil that is going into the engine.</p><p>When checking engine oil and fluid levels, it is important to only attempt this before driving and when the engine is cold, as firstly, when the engine is warm these fluids expand and will show a higher reading, and secondly and more importantly, for safety reasons and to prevent burns as the engine and engine components can become very hot very quickly.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wiper Blades and Fluid Levels</strong></h3><p>The wiper blades are an important safety feature on any vehicle and often they are overlooked. To ensure optimal wiper performance and longevity we recommend simply wiping over them with a damp cloth when you get fuel. We would also suggest giving the windscreen a once over with a chamois at the same time as keeping your windscreen clean will mean less work and resistance for the wipers.</p><p>Wiper fluid should be checked occasionally to ensure that it is not low, if this on the lower side this can be simply topped up with water until your next service, at the same time as checking this we would suggest activating the water jets for the wipers to ensure that these are working and there are no blockages in them.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lights</strong></h3><p>Every few weeks it is a good idea to check that all the external safety lights on your vehicle are in working order. This is extremely important for your own safety and the safety of other road users, and can also potentially save a fine that is not needed with many of the fines in NSW for vehicle lights not working being $116.</p><p>When checking external lights, have someone as an observer to help and if possible, do this in darker light. Check the indicator lights on the front, back and mirror, check the headlights (both low beam and high beam), check the fog lights, and check the brake lights.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Urgent Car Repairs</h2><p>There are some things that are so important to the efficient running of your vehicle, performance and most importantly safety that they simply cannot be overlooked until the next service and need immediate attention, these include;&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Engine/ Dashboard Lights</strong></h3><p>The lights on the dashboard are there for a reason and are oftentimes the first indicator that something is wrong. If a dashboard light comes on whether this be an engine light, a transmission light or any other light, this is something that needs to be looked into ASAP. Contact us at VAR Automotive and we will look into the issue and rectify the problem for you.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Squeaking Brakes</strong></h3><p>If you can hear that ghastly squeaking sound whenever you put your foot down on the brake pedal, this is a major sign that your brakes are suffering and need to be looked at immediately. Squeaking brakes are not just annoying on the ears, however it also means that should you need to brake heavily in an emergency situation you will be unable to stop as quickly or as safely as you could. For a brake inspection or service, contact us today.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Battery</strong></h3><p>If the lights on your dashboard don’t seem as bright as they should be or they dim when starting your vehicle, this is a sign that your battery is nearing the end of its life. Another sign of this is if your car is a bit sluggish when you go to turn the ignition. Having your battery inspected and replaced prior to it becoming flat, could be the difference between being stuck in a car park waiting for a mechanic or not enduring this frustration. If you suspect that your battery is near the end of its life, organise a battery inspection with us today.&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>A regular inspection and service doesn’t need to be overlooked leading to costly and easily preventable major repairs. Simply contact us at VAR Automotive and let us give your car the once over, best of all is that we can offer a convenient pick up and drop off service for all our customers within 10 kilometers of our prestige garage in Vaucluse.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section

class="elementor-widget-container"><p>Without trying to be cliche, until/if the day comes when we are all floating around in hover cars, the saying that “there are only four small pieces of rubber between you and the road” will continue to remain true. With this being said, tyre service and regular maintenance and upkeep are often overlooked in regular vehicle maintenance, and if neglected can have a negative impact on your hip pocket and in a worst case scenario, your safety.</p><p>With over 30 years of experience in servicing cars of all makes and models, and having seen the evolutions during this time from simple vehicle shape and design, to the introduction of safety technologies such as ABS brakes, to push start ignitions and lane departure warning systems and much much more, the humble tyre has gone relatively unchanged. Given the importance of tyre safety in Australia there are relatively simple things that can be done to improve their lifespan and performance, we thought we would share some of our favourite benefits of regular tyre servicing and maintenance.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Safety</h2><p>Naturally, safety is the number one reason in which tyres should be regularly checked with a tyre service near me, and basic maintenance undertaken as needed and a regular tyre servicing and replacement occurring when needed or when required to as per tyre manufacturers specifications. Tyres don’t just affect the safety of the person who is driving the vehicle in which they are on, however well maintained tyres help to ensure the safety of all other road users, whether this be other motorists, pedestrians and sometimes our furry little friends who mistakenly wander onto the road.</p><p>The difference between worn and non-worn tyres is often generally only a few millimeters, however in the event of heavy breaking in an emergency situation, undertaking an evasive maneuver, or needing to navigate a road surface covered in rain, the difference between worn and non-worn tyres could be the difference between safety and injury.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fuel Efficiency</h2><p>It is a little well known fact that there is a relationship between tyre performance and fuel efficiency, with happy tyres meaning an overall better fuel economy. With the price of fuel on the constant rise, by simply looking after your tyres with a regular tyre service, you could benefit from the savings when it comes time to fill up.</p><p>Ensuring that your tyres are inflated to the correct pressure, is one of the simplest ways to improve tyre performance and increase fuel savings, with proper and regular tyre rotation and wheel alignment also considered to significantly improve fuel economy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improved Lifespan</h2><p>As time goes on and as your tyres spend more time on the road doing what they do best, eventually they will become worn down and will need replacing. Often tyre manufacturers will have a stated kilometre interval life expectancy at which tyres should be replaced (the average nowadays is generally considered to be around the 40,000 kilometre mark, with most tyres falling short of this due to excacipated wear-and-tear). With this being said, by ensuring that your tyres are regularly inspected including tyre rotations and wheel alignment, this lifespan can be optimised without sacrificing safety or performance.</p><p>A number of the more common factors that can deteriorate tyres faster and lead to a lifespan that is significantly shorter than the manufacturer recommended life include; not ensuring that the tyre pressures are correct, excessive acceleration and braking as this causes more stress due to added friction between tyre and road, driving too fast around corners as this puts more stress on the side walls of the tyres than necessary, and last though not least is not ensuring the experts at VAR Automotive regularly inspect and repair your tyres as part of a regular scheduled service.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Smoother Ride</h2><p>A car’s suspension is a key component in ensuring the smoothness and a comfortable ride for you and your passengers. When you&#8217;re driving, one of the main things that can directly impact the performance of the suspension is the tyres. Tyres that have flat spots from excessive hard braking or have compromised side walls from cornering too fast, or are not aligned properly will ultimately impact upon the suspension system and your ride will not be as smooth as it could be.</p><p>Apart from being a crucial component of a smooth ride, the suspension system is made up of a number of different components, with a break in one part leading to further and unneeded stresses on other parts. With tyres and particularly their alignment having a direct impact on the suspension system, by ensuring your tyres are performing properly and are well aligned, you are less likely to incur the costs of replacing expensive suspension components.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Obeying The law</h2><p>As part of registering a car in NSW, a requirement is to have a completed eSafety inspection form, with the tyres being inspected as part of this process due to the high impact they can have on road safety. With the law stating that there must be a minimum of 1.5 millimeter of tread evenly across the tyre’s surface otherwise a defect will be issued, it is important to always ensure between eSafety inspections and scheduled services, that this is the case with all tyres. In the event you happen to be pulled over and there is less than 1.5 millimeters of tread, you will be fined $114 for each tyre that fails to comply and will have the additional expense of replacing the tyres and then having the defect cleared.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs of Tyre Wear &amp; Damage</h2><p>There are a number of signs of tyre wear and damage that we look for at VAR Automotive when inspecting your vehicle, and these will only take a few minutes of your time to have a quick check every now and then between scheduled services, these are;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>Worn tread &#8211; when the tread is visibly worn this means that the tyre is nearing the end of its lifespan and a tyre replacement is iminent</li><li>Cracked or damaged sidewalls &#8211; If there are visible cracks, damage of wear on the sides of the tyres this is a sure indicator that they will need to be rotated or replaced</li><li>Vibrations while driving &#8211; if you can feel a vibration when driving in a straight line or under light braking this is a sign that the wheel alignment is out and will need to be adjusted</li><li>Uneven wear &#8211; when looking at the tyre surface if the tread is uneven on one side of the tyre compared to the other this is generally a sign that the tyre will need to be rotated or replaced</li><li>Bulges &#8211; bulges in the tyre surface often indicate that a tyre’s pressure is too low or that there is an air leak which should be immediately addressed to prevent being stranded on the side of the road</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Maintenance Between Services</h2><p>There are a few basic maintenance tasks that you can do between scheduled services to ensure that your tyres remain safe and performing at their best, these are;</p><ul
class="wp-block-list"><li>Correct tyre pressure &#8211; regularly ensure that your tyre pressure is correct to the manufacturer&#8217;s specifications and adjusted for excessive increases in weight e.g. towing a trailer. It is best to check tyre pressure when the tyres are at a cooler temperature, so as soon as practical after hitting the road.</li><li>Regularly check for foriegn objects &#8211; every now and then inspect your tyres for any foreign objects that may be protruding from the surface such as a nail or screw (as this will ultimately end with a flat tyre), and look for any signs of cuts or scratches to the tyre surface.</li><li>Spare tyre &#8211; every now and then double check your spare tyre to ensure that there are no signs of damage and it is fully inflated. Due to spare tyres often spending so long hiding away and not being used, over time the tyre pressure may naturally drop (what could possibly be worse than having a flat spare tyre when you have a flat tyre?)</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Expert Maintenance (VAR)</h2><p>To ensure optimum safety and ultimate tyre performance and lifespan, ensuring that your tyres are regularly inspected, rotated, aligned and replaced as needed as part of a regular scheduled service is essential. You can take care of the basics such as checking the tyre pressure every other week, however when it comes to the bigger stuff it is better to leave this to the experts.</p><p>Feel free to contact us at any time, or fill out one of our online booking forms and let us take care of your tyre servicing needs.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section
